    "<b>Station Usage</b> Consider the set of turnstile machines that belong to some station $sta_j$. The station usage $u_j(n,m)$ for a time interval $I = [n,m]$ is defined as the aggregation of busy scores during $I$ for all turnstiles that belong to the station. That is,<p>\n",

For each station, the resulting time series can be modeled using linear regression as $u = a k + b$ where $u$ is the station montly usage and $k$ is the month (a value between 1 and 12). The term $a$ is the slope and $b$ is the intercept. We use $a$ as a mesure of yearly usage growth.
